More precisely, it is an arithmetic progression if a[i] - a[i-1] = a[i+1] - a[i] for every integer i such that 0 &lt; i &lt; N-1.

Sasha and Pasha are students sharing the same room. Once, when Pasha had left the room, Sasha was in a good mood. So he took a piece of chalk and wrote an arithmetic progression on the blackboard. The progression consisted of at least 4 elements, all of which were positive integers. Then Sasha went to class, and Pasha came back.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Pasha is a very nice person, but there's one problem with him -- he's frightened of even numbers! So, when he returned, he decided to make all the numbers on the board odd. He did this by repeatedly finding an arbitrary even number X, erasing it, and writing X/2 in its place. He continued to perform this step until no even numbers remained.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Your task is to help Sasha restore the initial progression. You will be given a vector &lt;int&gt; <b>seq</b>, where the i-th element is the i-th number in the sequence written on the blackboard after Pasha's actions. Return an vector &lt;int&gt; whose i-th element is the i-th number in a sequence that Sasha could have originally written on the blackboard. The constraints will ensure that at least one such sequence exists. If there are several such sequences, choose the one among them whose vector &lt;int&gt; representation is lexicographically smallest.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Definition</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Class:</td><td>AfraidOfEven</td></tr><tr><td>Method:</td><td>restoreProgression</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>vector &lt;int&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Returns:</td><td>vector &lt;int&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Method signature:</td><td>vector &lt;int&gt; restoreProgression(vector &lt;int&gt; seq)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(be sure your method is public)</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Notes</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>The lexicographically smaller of two different vector &lt;int&gt;s containing the same number of elements is the one with a smaller number at the first position where they differ.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>It is guaranteed that all elements of the resulting vector &lt;int&gt; will fit into a 32-bit signed integer data type.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Constraints</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>seq</b> will contain between 4 and 50 elements, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Each element of <b>seq</b> will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Each element of <b>seq</b> will be odd.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>There will exist at least one arithmetic progression from which Pasha would produce exactly the sequence described by <b>seq</b>.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Examples</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" nowrap="true">0)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td><table><tr><td><pre>{1, 1, 3, 1, 5}</pre></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><pre>Returns: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }</pre></td></tr><tr><td><table><tr><td colspan="2">If the progression written by Pasha was {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then Sasha would divide 2 by 2 once and 4 by 2 twice to produce exactly {1, 1, 3, 1, 5}.
